# Project 1 (Name Of Project When We Decide On One)

## Purpose Of The Project
The idea of this project is to educate the user with details pertaining to major urban areas. It displays a variety of area qualites that the user can click to dispay futher detailed qualites of that specific area and the statistics associated with them. 

## Functionality
This website works by typing in a name of a major urban area into the search bar. This seacrch bar does offer auto-complete of urban area names depending on the letters inputed. 

After inputing or selecting a name of an urban area you will then be able to click on the area qualites that you would like further information on. 

A drop down effect will then display more detailed information and statistics of the qualites associated with the area that is chosen.

There is a history section under the search bar that will save your searches. You can simply click any of the recent searches done to switch between them without having to type them again. This feature does not save duplicate searchs.
